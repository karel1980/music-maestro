Maestro is an AI-guided vocal coach, combining music theory with practical lessons for music enthusiasts.

#### Overview
Maestro is a site dedicated to helping users learn while providing instant feedback on performance even in the absence of a teacher. There are a series of lessons to guide the user through learning different notes. 

Each lesson has a series of video's for the user to watch followed by practice sessions. Each practice session displays the target notes a user must hit as well as displaying the pitch the user is currently hitting. This provides instant feedback for a person to know if they are on track.
